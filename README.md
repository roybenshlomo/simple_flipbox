# simple_flipbox
My wife is creating a WordPress website for her interior design business and wanted to have nice flipboxes that show an icon and a title on the front side and show some text at the back when the mouse hovers over it.

All the WordPress plugins she found to doing so were either crap or expensive.

# Disclaimer
I'm not a frontend developer and I know very little HTML and CSS if any, I built this from scraps and it fits a very specific goal but that can be expanded and reused.
